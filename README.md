# Overview
The provided Python scripts are part of a data analysis toolkit aimed at examining GitHub commit data. The scripts process a dataset containing various commit information and compute average statistics related to commits, projects, and users.

# File Descriptions
commit_analyzer.py, project_analyzer.py, user_analyzer.py: These scripts contain functions to analyze different aspects of commit data.
main.py: This is the entry point of the analysis, which loads the dataset and calls functions from other scripts to perform the analysis.
data_loader.py: A utility script for loading the dataset from a JSON file.
Purpose of the Code
Before Refactoring
The initial versions of commit_analyzer.py, project_analyzer.py, and user_analyzer.py included individual functions to classify and analyze commit data based on commit ID, project, and user respectively. Each of these functions had similar code structures, iterating over the dataset, extracting relevant information, and calculating averages.

# After Refactoring
The refactored code introduces a centralized classify function in commit_analyzer.py, which generalizes the classification process. This function is now imported and used in project_analyzer.py and user_analyzer.py, thereby reducing code redundancy and improving efficiency. The classify function takes the dataset and an index as arguments, allowing flexible extraction of different levels of data (commit, project, user).

# Edit Intention
The primary goal of refactoring was to enhance code efficiency and maintainability. By consolidating similar code patterns into a single, reusable function (classify), we avoid redundancy and make the codebase cleaner and more straightforward. This change not only makes the code more elegant but also eases future modifications and debugging.

# Usage
Run the main.py script to load the dataset and perform the analysis. The script outputs average statistics about the number of changes per commit, per project, and per user. It requires a dataset in JSON format, structured as a list of dictionaries with key commit_url, following the format: https://github.com/{repository_owner}/{repository_name}/commit/{commit_id}.
